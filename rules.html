                        <p>Homework is given on a regular basis in all compulsory subjects when children are ready to work independently. It is a reinforcement of skills learnt in school.

School office may be contacted in this regard.</p>

For illness which lead to quarantine period should be strictly monitored, in such case a written medical certificate is required for the child in order to be allowed to enter the school. A regular check on the child(s) hair, nails, teeth and undergarments for cleanliness purpose should be done. Daily bath is a must.</p>

                        <b>Head Lice Policy:</b>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>Our aim is for this whole process to be discreet & sensitive to all the people involved.
                        It’s nothing to be embarrassed about, but there are things you can do to minimise the impact on your family and your school community.</p>

                        <b>Head Lice Information</b>
                        <br><br>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Head lice are parasites that feed on human blood & live exclusively on humans</li>
                            <li>Having head lice does not reflect a lack of hygiene – they feed on blood regardless of hair cleanliness</li>
                            <li>Head lice do not hop or fly, but they can crawl at exceptional speeds. 95% of lice are transmitted by close contact</li>
                            <li>Brush your child’s hair frequently – head lice hate it. Nits are very small & it is possible to miss some in the initial treatment. If left untreated these will hatch within 7-10 days the whole cycle starts again. One adult head lice can lay about 6 eggs per day.</li>
                            <li>Child should be checked regularly for head lice – weekly, or daily during an outbreak. Early treatment can prevent spread to further close contacts</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        
                        <b>Head Lice Treatment</b>
                        <br><br>

                        <ul>

                            <li>Upon detection of head lice your child will need to be treated before they can return to the school classroom. The treatment process can be a time consuming task but very necessary. Please read the instructions of the treatment and follow closely.</li>
                            <li>Hats, hair brushes, pillowslips should all be washed in hot water.</li>
                            <li>It is recommended that all family members be treated as well.</li>
                            <li> On return to school, your child will be checked by the prefects</li>
                            <li>Your child should be treated again 3 days later, in case lice were missed in the first treatment.</li>
                            <li>After treatment, comb the hair with a fine-tooth comb to remove any eggs.</li>
                            <li>Every 2nd day after, for 10 days, (to cover the hatching cycle) comb hair conditioner through dry hair & comb again in sections with a metal fine-tooth comb. The hair conditioner immobilizes the lice and makes it easier to trap them in the teeth of the comb. Wipe the comb frequently on paper towel. To help your child sit still for this, offer distracting activities – play a favourite video, provide games, encourage reading, offer a head massage.</li>
                            <li>Tie long hair back, braid or put up. Head lice do not like short or plaited hair.</li>
                            <li>Remind your child to avoid head-to-head contact with other children. Eg working at the colouring, writing, playing, hugging.</li>
                        </ul>
